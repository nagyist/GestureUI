This app just calls the Test() method in a whole bunch of classes. If
you're struggling to understand how to use some class, stepping through
its Test() method in a debugger is a great way to see how to use it
(because if the test is any good, it will exercize the main
functionality of the class).<br>
<br>
If you add a new class to GClasses, it's a good idea to also add a test
so we'll know if there are regressions.<br>
