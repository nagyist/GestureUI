World Demo<br>

<br>
<p>There are 3 hello world demo apps: hello_console, hello_gui, and hello_web.</p>

<br><img src="hello.png"><br>

<p>If you want a really simple hello world app, hello_console is the one for you. It just prints a message to the console like a traditional hello world app, and also links to the GClasses library so you can access its various tools. If you want to create a console-based machine learning app, this is a good place to start.</p>

<p>The hello_gui demo is a little bit bigger. It demonstrates a very simple app that uses a graphical interface, and also links to the GClasses library. If you need to visualize something while it runs, this would be a good starting point.</p>

<p>Finally, the hello_web app demonstrates a simple app with a web interface. If you want to write a machine learning tool that will be accessible to the whole world, this would be a good starting point.</p>
