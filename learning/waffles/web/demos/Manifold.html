This is a demo of a manifold learning algorithm.<br>
<br>
<br><img src="Manifold.png"><br><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Swiss Roll Demo</span> - Starts with a
collection of points in 3D space on a 2D Swiss Roll manifold, and
reduces the data to two dimensions.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Semi-supervised Demo</span> - This is
the same as the Swiss Roll Demo, but when it's done, click on the 'X'
and it will randomly pick 5% of the data to use to supervise the next
pass. Then it will do it again. Note that it's much faster the second
time because it has some supervision.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">S-Curve Demo</span> - Starts with
points in 3D space on an 2D S-Curve manifold, and reduces the data to
two dimensions.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Entwined Spirals Demo</span> - Starts
with points in 3D space on a 1D manifold of entwined spirals, and
reduces the data to one dimension.<br>
