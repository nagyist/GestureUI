      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Note that there are much better
algorithms for doing high-quality interpolation than any of these
methods. The real purpose of this demo is to give a visual "feel" for
the differences between several learning algorithms.<br>
      <br>
The tiny image in the top-left is the training set. Each algorithm has
two inputs (x, y) and one output (grayscale value). The big images are
produced by evaluating with sub-pixel inputs.<br>
      <br>
The four algorithms on the bottom are fast enough that the
interpolation is performed entirely before this screen appears.<br>
      <br>
The six algorithms on the top all use the same neural net model, but
use different search algorithms to train it. You can watch in real time
while they train. They each take turns so that each algorithm gets the
same amount of time in the long run. As you'll see, on-line
backpropagation beats the other algorithms. Momentum Greedy comes in
second. The others are painfully slow. I'm a bit uncertain if my
Partical Swarm implementation is correct, because I'm told it is an
effective way to train a neural net, but it doesn't seem to work so
well for me.<br>
