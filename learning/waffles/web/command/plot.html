<pre>

waffles_plot [command]
   Visualize data, plot functions, make charts, etc.
   3d [dataset] &lt;options&gt;
      Make a 3d scatter plot. Points are colored with a spectrum according to
      their order in the dataset.
      [dataset]
         The filename of an arff file containing the data to plot. It must have
         exactly 3 continuous attributes.
      &lt;options&gt;
         -blast
            Produce a 5-by-5 grid of renderings, each time using a random point
            of view. It will print the random camera directions that it selects
            to stdout.
         -seed [value]
            Specify a seed for the random number generator.
         -size [width] [height]
            Sets the size of the image. The default is 1000 1000.
         -pointradius [radius]
            Set the size of the points. The default is 40.0.
         -bgcolor [color]
            Set the background color. The default is ffffff.
         -cameradistance [dist]
            Set the distance between the camera and the mean of the data. This
            value is specified as a factor, which is multiplied by the distance
            between the min and max corners of the data. The default is 1.5.
            (If the camera is too close to the data, make this value bigger.)
         -cameradirection [dx] [dy] [dz]
            Specifies the direction from the camera to the mean of the data.
            (The camera always looks at the mean.) The default is 0.6 -0.3
            -0.8.
         -out [filename]
            Specify the name of the output file. (The default is plot.png.) It
            should have the .png extension because other image formats are not
            yet supported.
         -nolabels
            Don't put axis labels on the bounding box.
         -nobox
            Don't draw a bounding box around the plot.
   bar [dataset] &lt;options&gt;
      Make a bar chart.
      [dataset]
         The filename of an arff file containing the data for the bar chart.
         The dataset must contain exactly one continuous attribute. Each data
         row specifies the height of a bar.
      &lt;options&gt;
         -log
            Use a logarithmic scale.
         -out [filename]
            Specifies the name of the output file. (The default is plot.png.)
            It should have the .png extension because other image formats are
            not yet supported.
   bigo [dataset]
      Estimate the Big-O runtime of algorithms based on empirical results.
      Regresses the formula t=a*(n^b+c) to fit the data, where n is the value
      in attribute 0 (representing the size of the data), and t (representing
      time) in the other attributes for each algorithm. The values of a, b, and
      c are reported for each attribute &gt; 0.
   equation &lt;options&gt; [equations]
      Plot an equation (or multiple equations) in 2D
      &lt;options&gt;
         -out [filename]
            Specify the name of the output file. (The default is plot.png.) It
            should have the .png extension because other image formats are not
            yet supported.
         -size [width] [height]
            Specify the size of the chart. (The default is 1024 1024.)
         -range [xmin] [ymin] [xmax] [ymax]
            Set the range. (The default is: -10 -10 10 10.)
      [equations]
         A set of equations separated by semicolons. Since '^' is a special
         character for many shells, it's usually a good idea to put your
         equations inside quotation marks. Here are some examples:
         "f1(x)=3*x+2"
         "f1(x)=(g(x)+1)/g(x); g(x)=sqrt(x)+pi"
         "h(bob)=bob^2;f1(x)=3+bar(x,5)*h(x)-(x/foo);bar(a,b)=a*b-b;foo=3.2"
         Only functions that begin with 'f' followed by a number will be
         plotted, starting with 'f1', and it will stop when the next number in
         ascending order is not defined. You may define any number of helper
         functions or constants with any name you like. Built in constants
         include: e, and pi. Built in functions include: +, -, *, /, %, ^, abs,
         acos, acosh, asin, asinh, atan, atanh, ceil, cos, cosh, erf, floor,
         gamma, lgamma, log, max, min, sin, sinh, sqrt, tan, and tanh. These
         generally have the same meaning as in C, except '^' means exponent,
         "gamma" is the gamma function, and max and min can support any number
         (&gt;=1) of parameters. (Some of these functions may not not be available
         on Windows, but most of them are.) You can override any built in
         constants or functions with your own variables or functions, so you
         don't need to worry too much about name collisions. Variables must
         begin with an alphabet character or an underscore. Multiplication is
         never implicit, so you must use a '*' character to multiply.
         Whitespace is ignored.
   histogram [dataset] &lt;options&gt;
      Make a histogram.
      [dataset]
         The filename of an arff file containing the data for the histogram.
         The dataset must contain exactly one continuous attribute.
      &lt;options&gt;
         -size [width] [height]
            Specify the size of the chart. (The default is 1024 1024.)
         -attr [index]
            Specify which attribute is charted. (The default is 0.)
         -out [filename]
            Specify the name of the output file. (The default is plot.png.) It
            should have the .png extension because other image formats are not
            yet supported.
         -range [xmin] [xmax] [ymax]
            Specify the range of the histogram plot
   model [model-file] [dataset] [attr-x] [attr-y]
      Plot the model space of a trained supervised learning algorithm.
      [model-file]
         The filename of the trained model. (You can use "waffles_learn train"
         to make a model file.)
      [dataset]
         The filename of a dataset in arff format to be plotted. It can be the
         training set that was used to train the model, or a test set that it
         hasn't yet seen.
      [attr-x]
         The zero-based index of a continuous feature attributes for the
         horizontal axis.

      &lt;options&gt;
         -out [filename]
            Specify the name of the output file. (The default is plot.png.) It
            should have the .png extension because other image formats are not
            yet supported.
         -cellsize [value]
            Change the size of each cell. The default is 100.

      Print a textual representation of a decision tree to stdout.
      [model-file]
         The filename of a trained decision tree model. (You can make one with
         the command "waffles_learn train [dataset] decisiontree &gt;
         [filename]".)
      &lt;dataset&gt;
         An optional filename of the arff file that was used to train the
         decision tree. The data in this file is ignored, but the meta-data
         will be used to make the printed model richer.
   scatter [dataset] &lt;options&gt;
      Makes a scatter plot or line graph.
      [dataset]
         The filename of a dataset in arff format to be plotted. The first
         attribute specifies the values on the horizontal axis. All other
         attributes specify the values on the vertical axis for a certain
         color.
      &lt;options&gt;
         -lines
            Draw lines connecting sequential point in the data. (In other
            words, make a line graph instead of a scatter plot.)
         -size [width] [height]
            Specify the size of the chart. (The default is 1024 1024.)
         -logx
            Show the horizontal axis on a logarithmic scale
         -logy

            Set the size of the point dots. The default is 7.0.
         -linethickness [value]

         -range [xmin] [ymin] [xmax] [ymax]
            Sets the range. (The default is to determine the range
            automatically.)
         -aspect
            Adjust the range to preserve the aspect ratio. In other words, make
            sure that both axes visually have the same scale.
         -chartcolors [background] [text] [grid]
            Sets colors for the specified areas. (The default is ffffff 000000
            808080.)
         -linecolors [c1] [c2] [c3] [c4]

            0000a0 a00000 008000 504010 (blue, red, green, brown). (If there
            are more than four lines, it will just distribute them evenly over
            the color spectrum.)
         -spectrum
            Instead of giving each line a unique color, this will use the color
            spectrum to indicate the position of each point within the data.
         -specmod [cycle]
            Like -spectrum, except it repeats the spectrum with the specified
            cycle size.
         -out [filename]
            Specifies the name of the output file. (The default is plot.png.)
            It should have the .png extension because other image formats are
            not yet supported.
         -neighbors [neighbor-finder]
            Draw lines connecting each point with its neighbors as determined
            by the specified neighbor finding algorithm.
   stats [dataset]
