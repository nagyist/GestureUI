<h2>waffles_generate</h2>
<p>
	A command-line tool to help generate various types of data.
	(Most of the datasets it generates are for testing manifold learning
	algorithms. I add them as I need them.) Here's the usage information:</p>
<pre>

waffles_generate [command]
   Generate certain useful datasets
   crane &lt;options&gt;
      Generate a dataset where each row represents a ray-traced image of a
      crane with a ball.
      &lt;options&gt;
         -saveimage [filename]
            Save an image showing all the frames.
         -ballradius [size]
            Specify the size of the ball. The default is 0.3.
         -frames [horiz] [vert]
            Specify the number of frames to render.
         -size [wid] [hgt]
            Specify the size of each frame.
         -blur [radius]
            Blurs the images. A good starting value might be 5.0.
         -gray
            Use a single grayscale value for every pixel instead of three (red,
            green, blue) channel values.
   cube [n]
      returns data evenly distributed on the surface of a unit cube. Each side
      is sampled with [n]x[n] points. The total number of points in the dataset
      will be 6*[n]*[n]-12*[n]+8.
   docstosparsematrix &lt;options&gt; [folder1] [folder2] ...
      Converts a set of documents to a sparse matrix. [folder1] should contain
      all of the documents in class1. [folder2] should contain all the
      documents in class2, and so forth. The words are filtered against a
      common set of stop words. Also, words less than 4 letters are ignored.
      Currently, only .txt and .html documents are supported. Other file types
      are ignored. Each row in the sparse matrix represents one of the
      documents. If there is more than one folder/class, then an additional
      column is added for the class label. Subdirectories are not followed.
      Results are saved to a text file in compressed-column format. A mapping
      from row number to document filename is printed to stdout.
      &lt;options&gt;
         -nostem
            Specifies not to stem the words. (The default is to use the Porter
            stemming algorithm.)
         -binary
            Just use the value 1 if the word occurs in a document. The default
            is to compute the somewhat more meaningful value: a*log(b/c)/d,
            where a=the number of times the word occurs in this document,
            b=total number of documents, c=number of documents that contain
            this word, and d=the max number of times this word occurs in any
            document.
         -outfile [filename]
            Specify the filename for the sparse matrix. The default is
            "docs.sparse".
         -vocabfile [filename]
            Save the vocabulary of words to the specified file. The default is
            to not save the list of words. Note that the words will be stemmed
            (unless -nostem was specified), so it is normal for many of them to
            appear misspelled.
   entwinedspirals [points] &lt;options&gt;
      Generates points that lie on an entwined spirals manifold.
      [points]

            Specify a seed for the random number generator.
         -reduced
            Generate intrinsic values instead of extrinsic values. (This might
            be useful to empirically measure the accuracy of a manifold
            learner.)

      Generate samples on the surface of a fish-bowl manifold.
      &lt;options&gt;

      around on a grid of observation vectors.

         in a grid.
      [width]
         The width of the grid.

            Specify a seed for the random number generator.

            Specify a seed for the random number generator.

               specify the probabilities of each of the 3 classes. (This is
               just an example. Other values besides 3 may be used for the
               number of classes.)
